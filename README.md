Welcome to the **Polkadot Italia** official repository. 🇮🇹

This project is a community-driven reimagining of the official [Polkadot.com](https://polkadot.com) website. It has been localized for the Italian community while maintaining the high-performance standards and the "Second Age" brand aesthetics of the original site.

## 🎯 Project Vision

This repository is built following Polkadot's core principles of **open-source** and **sovereignty**.

> **Are you a member of a regional community?**
> You are free (and encouraged!) to fork this repository to create a localized version of Polkadot for your own country (e.g., Polkadot France, Polkadot Spain, Polkadot Japan, etc.). The codebase is lightweight, fast, and easy to translate.
