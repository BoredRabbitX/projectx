# Polkadot Regional Community Template

Welcome to the **Polkadot Italia** official repository. 

This project is a community-driven reimagining of the official [Polkadot.com](https://polkadot.com) website. It has been localized for the Italian community while maintaining the high-performance standards and "Second Age" brand aesthetics of the original site.

## 🌐 Project Vision

This repository is built with the Polkadot principles of **open-source** and **sovereignty** in mind. 

**Are you a member of a regional community?**
You are free (and encouraged!) to fork this repository to create a localized version of Polkadot for your own country (e.g., Polkadot France, Polkadot Spain, Polkadot Japan, etc.). The codebase is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to translate.

## 🚀 Technical Features

* **Minimalist Design**: Fully aligned with the Polkadot "Second Age" brand identity.
* **Performance**: Built using only Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No heavy frameworks to ensure lightning-fast loading speeds.
* **Interactive Background**: Custom WebGL Shader (Noise Effect) that reacts to mouse movement.
* **Dark/Light Mode**: Native support for theme switching with visual persistence.
* **Mobile Ready**: Fully responsive design with a dedicated mobile hamburger menu.
